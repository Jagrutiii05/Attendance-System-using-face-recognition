# Attendance System using Face Recognition

## Introduction
The Face Recognition Attendance System was an initiative aimed at automating the attendance process using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. However, due to challenges in achieving the required minimum accuracy, we decided to explore alternative approaches. This transition has led to further exploration into machine learning and model training methodologies.

## Challenges with KNN Algorithm
Despite initial efforts, the KNN algorithm did not meet the desired accuracy threshold for face recognition in the attendance system. Some challenges encountered include:

**Limited Discriminative Features:** The KNN algorithm struggled to identify distinctive features necessary for accurate face recognition, leading to inconsistent results.
**Scalability Issues:** As the dataset grew, the computational complexity of the KNN algorithm became a bottleneck, impacting performance and accuracy.
**Parameter Sensitivity:** Fine-tuning parameters such as the number of neighbors (K) proved challenging, as small variations often resulted in significant changes in accuracy.

## Learning and Growth
While the initial endeavor with the KNN algorithm presented challenges, it served as a valuable learning experience that encouraged further exploration into the field of machine learning. This journey has inspired a deeper understanding of classifier algorithms, model training techniques, and the broader applications of artificial intelligence in real-world scenarios.
